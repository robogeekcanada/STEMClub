        "Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[1][2] It is seen as a **subset of artificial intelligence**. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make **predictions or decisions** without being explicitly programmed to do so.[3] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

        "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique that finds and analyzes hidden patterns in “raw” or unlabeled data. By ignoring labels altogether, a model using** unsupervised learning can infer subtle, complex relationships between unsorted data that semi-supervised learning** (where some data is labeled as a reference) would miss. And do so without the **time and costs needed for supervised learning** (where all data is labeled).\n",

Compared to supervised learning where training data is labeled with the appropriate classifications, methods using unsupervised learning must learn relationships between elements in a dataset without labeling the data as any particular classification. Because of this,  **unsupervised learning serves as a great way to uncover hidden structures within data that may not be evident otherwise**. \n",
